Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **npm** (or **yarn** or **pnpm**)
- **MongoDB** (or a cloud instance like MongoDB Atlas)
- **Cloudinary Account** for image upload configuration

## Local Setup

2. Install Dependencies

3.  Configure Environment Variables
	Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the necessary environment variables. Obtain the required values from the GitHub Developer Settings[https://github.com/settings/developers], Google Cloud Console[https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials], and Cloudinary upload[https://console.cloudinary.com/settings/c-83e3a396836394c5dbb29277cf4987/upload]. Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials for GitHub, Google, Cloudinary, and MongoDB.
	```bash
	GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
	GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
	GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
	GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
	NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
	NEXTAUTH_SECRET=MD23kjNvuj7WTIDYcM1T9kPB+uCChqj4ERN1Uu6pykKY=
	DATABASE_URL=""
	NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=""
	NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=""
	CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
	CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
	```
4. Prisma Setup
	```bash
	npx prisma db pull
	npx prisma migrate dev --name model-added
	npx prisma generate
	npx prisma studio
	```
5. Run the Development Server
	```bash
	pnpm run dev
	```
	This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.
6. Access the Application
	Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the blog application in action.
